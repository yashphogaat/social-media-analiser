This app uses a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model to analyze social media usage patterns.

*Note:* This is a demonstration app. In a real-world scenario, the model would be fine-tuned on actual social media usage data.

*Guidelines:*
- 0-1 hours: Generally considered healthy
- 1-2 hours: Moderate usage
- 2-3 hours: Approaching excessive
- 3+ hours: Often considered excessive for adults

These guidelines may vary based on age, profession, and purpose of use.
